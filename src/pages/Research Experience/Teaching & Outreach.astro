<h2> Teaching and Outreach Experience</h2>
   <h4>Graduate School Ambassador, Oregon State University (2018–2022)</h4>
<ul class="list-disc pl-6">
As a Graduate School Ambassador, I represented Oregon State University to prospective students and helped guide new recruits through the transition to graduate life. This role combined mentorship, outreach, and communication, as I connected with students from diverse backgrounds, shared my experiences as a researcher, and supported the university’s efforts to build an inclusive and welcoming graduate community. Actively participated in recruitment and raising funds for networking conferences and outreach.
</ul>


<h4>Undergraduate & Graduate Mentor, Oregon State University (2018–2022)</h4>
<ul class="list-disc pl-6">
During my doctoral training, I mentored both undergraduate and graduate students in the laboratory, guiding them from project design through to data analysis and publication. I emphasized independent thinking, helping students develop ownership of their work while also teaching them the practical and theoretical skills needed to succeed in research. Several of the projects I supervised culminated in publications, underscoring my commitment to training the next generation of scientists.
</ul>


<h4>SACNAS Volunteer Mentor, Oregon State University (2018–2022)</h4>
<ul class="list-disc pl-6">
As part of my involvement with SACNAS (Society for the Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science), I served as a volunteer mentor, providing support to students navigating both academic and personal challenges. I worked to foster a sense of belonging in STEM for underrepresented students, reinforcing that their perspectives and contributions are critical to advancing the field.
</ul>


<h4>Chair and Organizer, SACNAS Symposium “Opportunities in Actinide Chemistry” (2019)</h4>
<ul class="list-disc pl-6">
I organized and chaired a national SACNAS conference symposium showcasing career pathways and cutting-edge research in actinide chemistry. My responsibilities included recruiting speakers, curating the program, and moderating discussions. The symposium not only highlighted the scientific importance of actinide chemistry but also created a platform for students and early-career researchers to engage directly with leaders in the field.
</ul>


<h4>Teaching Assistant, Oregon State University (2017)</h4>
<ul class="list-disc pl-6">
As a Teaching Assistant, I supported instruction in general chemistry, leading recitations, grading, and providing individualized guidance to students. This experience allowed me to refine my ability to communicate complex scientific concepts in accessible ways and to recognize the different learning styles that students bring into the classroom.
</ul>


<h4>Volunteer Tutor, Fordham University (2016–2017)</h4>
<ul class="list-disc pl-6">
While completing my undergraduate degree, I volunteered as a chemistry tutor for undergraduates, assisting students with coursework, problem-solving strategies, and exam preparation. This early teaching experience solidified my commitment to education and helped me discover the satisfaction of supporting others in building their confidence and understanding in science.
