			<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p class="max-w-2xl mx-auto mt-4">
					I’m Ian Colliard, Ph.D., a postdoctoral researcher at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where I study the chemistry of polyoxometalate (POM) complexes of lanthanides 					and actinides. My research integrates crystallography, spectroscopy, and data-driven analysis to uncover how structure controls luminescence and photophysical behavior, 					with the broader goal of advancing new materials for photonics and quantum technologies.
				</p>
				<p>
					My path in science began early, I developed a fascination with chemistry at the age of ten, graduated from high school in Florida, and moved to New York City at sixteen to 					begin my bachelor’s degree. By nineteen I had completed my undergraduate studies, and by twenty-three I had earned my Ph.D. in inorganic chemistry. This accelerated 						academic trajectory reflects both my dedication to research and my ability to thrive in challenging, fast-paced environments.
				</p>
				<p>
					Since then, I have published over 170 crystal structures and multiple high-impact papers, building a portfolio that connects fundamental chemistry with cutting-edge 						applications. I am equally passionate about mentoring students, fostering inclusive scientific communities, and creating bridges between disciplines. Beyond the lab, I 					enjoy projects that blend science and creativity, from 3D-printing molecular models, designing research-inspired artwork to exploring new hiking trails, or planning my 					next trip abroad. I’ve always enjoyed blending science with creativity, whether through building models, developing my own film photography toner (netural Mn brown), or 					even my tattoos inspired by physics and crystallography. These hobbies give me fresh perspective and keep me grounded when research gets intense.

			<h2>Curiosity Driven Exploration</h2>
			<p>
				I approach science as a form of exploration, each unexpected peak or anomaly is an opportunity to uncover new knowledge. My research is guided by curiosity, driving me to ask 					questions at the frontiers of chemistry and to see every result as a doorway to discovery.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div slot="column-2-body">
			<h2>Precision and Rigor</h2>
			<p>
				I believe that impactful science rests on careful and reproducible methods. I strive for rigor and transparency so that my work is not only accurate but also useful and accessible 				to the broader scientific community.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div slot="column-3-body">
			<h2>Mentorship and Accessibility</h2>
			<p>
				Research is not complete until it is shared and taught. I am committed to mentoring students and creating pathways for others to engage with complex science, making it 					approachable through outreach, collaboration, and open communication.
